Asterisk Management Interface (AMI)
===================================

A simple, if verbose, AMI implementation is provided below, demonstrating how to connect to Asterisk
with MD5-based authentication, how to connect callback handlers for events, and how to send requests
for information::

    _PASSWORD = 'wordpass'

        with the `Manager` object directly, but this is probably a better approach for most
        general-purpose applications.
