pystrix
=======

pystrix is a collection of classes that provide a simple interface for
interacting with an Asterisk server with Python.

It differs from its contemporaries by being provided as a toolkit, rather than
a framework, allowing it to be used as part of larger projects that may be
incompatible, by design or evolution, with the Twisted framework.

Usage
-----

Importing this package, or the 'agi' or 'ami' sub-packages is recommended over
importing individual modules.
